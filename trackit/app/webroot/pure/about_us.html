		<h1>Why this site ? </h1>
		<p>We coded C and assembly for last 10 years. They said we weren't fit for a web-tech job. So, we set out to create something, to let our prospective employers know that 'C & hardware-guys' could also do web stuff. Though the job is not even partly done, because it still looks bare and UI is unimpressive, but it is a good start with a healthy backend ;).</p>
